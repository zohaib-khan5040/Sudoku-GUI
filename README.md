# Sudoku-GUI
game.py consists of some helper functions that are able to generate a random solvable Sudoku grid. 
display.py constructs the GUI and allows the user to play the game: with the mouse one is able to fill in boxes and press Enter to commit to a number; press the Spacebar to see how a Backtracking algorithm is used to solve the Grid from the beginning.
